# Arduino Snake
Snake game using an Arduino board and a Nokia 5110 screen.
The control is done using the Serial (I didn't have 4-5 buttons availables). With the arduino program, I have included a small server in nodejs that allows the control of the game using a browser. The control can be made using the WASD keys (and p/spacebar to pause) or the mouse/touchscreen.
